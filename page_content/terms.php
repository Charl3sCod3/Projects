						Essentially, the following agreements and conditions are made by Inside Dinagat’s team to prevent misunderstandings between business owners and the clients. In short, terms and conditions give control over the site and legal enforcement if users try to take advantage of your operations.<br> The agreement helps:<br> 
•	Protect your intellectual property.<br> 
•	Avoid website abuse.<br> 
•	Define the limits of legal obligations to the consumer.<br> 
Please read the following:<br> 	
•	Abusive Users: Terms and Conditions agreements allow you to establish what constitutes appropriate activity on your site, empowering you to remove abusive users and content that violates guidelines.<br> 
•	Intellectual Property Theft: Asserting your claim to the creative assets of your site with regards to terms and conditions will prevent ownership disputes and copyright infringement.<br> 
•	Potential Litigation: If a user lodges a legal complaint against your business, showing that they were presented with clear terms and conditions before they used your site will help you immensely in court.<br>
